        <p class="biography-text">
          My name is Kamila. I am 21 years old. I am a third-year KBTU student, majoring in IT Management. I was born in Shymkent city and lived there until I graduated from high school at NIS. My interest in studying programming began in the 10th grade. Since high school, I have been learning C#, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, and by the 12th grade, I had firmly decided that I would apply to a technical university to pursue an IT degree.
        </p>
        <p class="biography-text">
          At the moment, I have many interests and areas that I want to explore in depth. I'm currently trying my hand at various fields, such as UX/UI design, frontend development, Python, C++, 1C, and more. After studying all these areas, I will decide which one I want to focus on the most and where I can excel the best.

          Sports and education are among the main priorities in my life, helping me continuously develop and achieve my goals. I have been involved in sports since the age of 7. I practiced rhythmic gymnastics for 3 years, then after quitting gymnastics, I periodically engaged in dancing until I was 17. For the past 4 years, Iâ€™ve been going to the gym intermittently and trying out different fields such as boxing, stretching, and more.
        </p>

          Since childhood, my parents made sure I always studied in the best schools and strived to provide me with a quality education. Starting from the 4th grade, I attended educational courses. Up until high school, I struggled with math, so I consistently took extra courses to better understand it. In high school, I began preparing for exams like IELTS and SAT. Thanks to my parents, who started preparing me from the 4th grade, and my own perseverance despite the challenges, I was accepted into one of the best schools in Kazakhstan and after graduation, I won scholarships to 4 international foreign universities.

          Initially, because my mother is an English teacher, I excelled in languages and thought I would become a translator in the future. At the age of 18, I started teaching English to young children. However, in high school, I developed an interest in IT, especially after recognizing the potential of this field.
